    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This is the best chili recipe I have ever tried. I'm not sure where the recipe originated, but it is amazing! Sometimes, I don't bother adding all four cans of the kidney beans, but I like my chili thick and meaty. </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can of stewed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can of kidney beans with liquid</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can of pinto beans with liquid</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups of water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 dash of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 dash of hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®), or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef and onion in a large skillet until meat is brown and onions are tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer beef and onion mixture to a slow cooker; stir in tomatoes, tomato sauce, kidney beans, pinto beans, and water.</li>
        <li>Season with chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and hot pepper sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
